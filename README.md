# adventofcode2022

I have wanted to solve Advent Of Code for a long time. 
But december is always too busy for me. 
So now I take my time and solve the 25 days of each 2 assignments in my own pace and without getting help. 

I am coding in Python and it works like a charm. I am happy to be reunited with Numpy and other packages :-)

I guess I will choose another language next time.
